## React App

Example of React app with GMaps

In this project I did use:
- Webpack
- React
- Babel
- Some of ES6 features

For use it:

1. Download or Clone repository
2. Enter in folder in terminal
3. Execute command
  
  ```
  npm install
  ```
4. And then:
  
  ```
  npm run start
  ```
  After build, enter in your browser <http://localhost:8080>, this is App on local server.
  
#### Some App features
1. Enter the name Street or City and press Enter.
2. Click at the Star icon near current location name. That action will save this location to the list of favourites locations. You can add several locations.
3. Click on some name in the saved locations list, the map and current location name will switch to chosen location.
4. Click on the Star icon again, it will become 'empty' and location will be removed from the list.
